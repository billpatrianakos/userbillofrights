# The Internet User's Bill of Rights

This is the Wordpress theme for the [Internet User's Bill of Rights](http://userbillofrights.org) website. The User Bill of Rights came about from [this HN discussion](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5220072). The site should be up within a few hours.

You're free to use this design but the content cannot be used verbatim.

## The Original User's Bill of Rights

1. Notice of changes to service and policies

If a policy is going to change or a feature is going to be added, removed, or modified we should get some sort of notice via email, blog post or preferably both.

2. The right of free users to keep their active accounts for as long as the service stays in business
If I have a free Google account I expect that so long as I'm using it reasonably often Google won't decide one day to just get rid of all free accounts.

3. The right to continue using the core offering regardless of feature additions, subtractions, or modifications for any other account type.
So as an Instagram user I should be able to take, post, like, and comment on photos as that is the very core of the product. If one day Instagram has paid accounts I'm not entitled to any of the upgraded features but I should never lose the ability to use the service in its most basic ways because I'm using it free.

4. For services to act in accordance with applicable laws and, more importantly, strive to never enter legal "gray area" in matters that directly affect users.
